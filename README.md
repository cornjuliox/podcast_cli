# ABOUT THIS PROJECT
The goal of this project is to build something that supports my personal podcast listening habits. I'd like to have a command line application that I can run once a day, via cron, and put together a daily playlist that contains the latest episodes for the dozen-or-so podcasts I listen to on a regular basis.


# TECH STACK
- Python 3.9 (latest and greatest lol)
- Peewee: provides a nice interface to sqlite
- Click: provides the framework for building a good CLI
